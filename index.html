                <strong>Real Estate</strong>
                <p>I grew up going to construction sites and open houses, and to this day, I'm addicted to houses. I'm a homeowner, landlord and real estate investor. This is my latest project - a full remodel of a 1925 Queen Anne charmer.</p>

                <strong>Edible Gardening</strong>
                <p>Years before Michelle Obama planted the White House Victory Garden, I got interested in growing food, both annual vegetables and perennial edibles. These raised beds are just getting started and I'm looking to a great 2019 season.</p>

                <strong>Travel</strong>
                <p>There's a saying printed on the office wall at Expedia, where I've been contracting for 15 years: 
                <blockquote>
                We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us.
                </blockquote>
                My most recent trip was to Jeju Island and Seoul in Korea this April.</p>
